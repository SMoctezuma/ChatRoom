# ChatRoom
ChatRoom with server host and multiple client communication
You have to export the server jar and client jar seperately.
If you run the jar under two instances and pick the same ip and port, you can chat with the other person. Doesn't have to be local. For the server to run, the command line is "java -jar jarname.jar [port]". Of course thats assuming you've navigated to the jar path through terminal. Default port is 8192. The server automatically assigns each user a different id however people can join with the same names. Never got around to make this program too in depth, just wanted to learn the networking aspect and get working dialog.
